                more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</div>
            <div class="secondary-text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
                make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </div>

                attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</div>

            <div class="primary-text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </div>
            <div class="secondary-text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</div>
